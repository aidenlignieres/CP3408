While following the tutorial it was easy to understand how to adjust more unique attributes for any prefabs.
The instruction in the tutorial was clear and gave excellent description to certain tasks or elements which
are important. Going through the task gave an understanding on how most unity games are developed, even the 
most basic games as well as how much time and effect is put in to create a functional game. The experience 
that I felt during the prac was new and exciting as doing something like developing a game which could have 
other people can enjoy playing my games. When looking at all the elements and attempting to remember what 
each thing does was very difficult at first but after running though it a couple of times allow me to have a 
better understanding on what I will need to do for when I design/make a game in the feature. On of the difficult
thing that I had was trying to like the unity project to a GitHub repo and that lead to me making a SSH key 
as, this would allow for git pushes which would either require a password or not depending on which SSH key was
assign to the GitHub repo.
